     # Q3: What is the benefit of using @property and @target.setter?
    # Using @property lets us access the target like a normal variable while still keeping it private.
    # The setter lets us control what values are allowed, so we can stop empty values from being set.
    # This helps prevent mistakes and keeps the program more reliable.

# Q1: How does PortScanner reuse code from NetworkTool?
# PortScanner inherits from NetworkTool, so it can use everything already written in that class.
# For example, it uses the target variable and its validation without rewriting it.
# This saves time and keeps the code cleaner since we don’t repeat the same logic.

        # If there was no try-except, the program could crash when a port fails or the host can't be reached.
        # This would stop the scan completely instead of continuing with other ports.

    # Q2: Why do we use threading instead of scanning one port at a time?
    # Threading lets the program check multiple ports at the same time instead of one by one.

    # If we scanned 1024 ports one at a time, it would take way longer to finish.

# Q5: New Feature Proposal
# One additional feature I would add is a filter that shows only important or high-risk ports after the scan is complete.
# This could use a list comprehension to return only results for selected ports such as 22, 80, 443, and 3389.
